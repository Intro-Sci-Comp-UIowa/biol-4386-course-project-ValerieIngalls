### Scripts

========================

This folder contains all R scripts and R Markdown files used.

Most of these file predate this class and this directory, but updated versions will live in this directory.

Current analyses are in zinc_copper_analysis.Rmd, and data cleaning is in zinc_copper_processing.Rmd; other markdown files are from an older run of the project and can be 
ignored. Some sections of the analysis file are also out of date, with updates still in progress. See comments within those documents for more details.
