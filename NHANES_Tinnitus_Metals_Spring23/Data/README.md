### Data

==========================

This folder contains any data used in this project. The subfolder contains raw data, preserved as it initially came downloaded from the NHANES website.

This level of the directory is dedicated to data sheets that are created as a result of cleaning/combining performed in R. No intermediate data sheets are written, as these 
are most conveniently stored only as dataframes in R.

Currently, the only sheet stored at this level is the finalized cleaned/processed table in csv form.
